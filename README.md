# mushroom-regression
Logistic regression project to predict mushroom toxicity using visual traits
#  Mushroom Classification (Logistic Regression in R)

This project predicts whether a mushroom is edible or poisonous using logistic regression in R. It includes data cleaning, visualization, model building, and performance evaluation.

## Files
- `mushroom.csv`: UCI mushroom dataset from kaggle
- `mushroom_regression.Rmd`: R Markdown with full analysis

## Tools Used
- R
- tidyverse, caret, glm, pROC, faraway

## Steps Covered
- NA and "?" cleaning
- EDA with boxplots, histograms, Q-Q plots
- Logistic regression with full + stepwise models
- Confusion matrix & ROC-AUC
- VIF multicollinearity check

## How to Run
1. Open `mushroom_regression.Rmd` in RStudio  
2. Click “Knit” to generate the HTML report  
3. Or read through the code and run step-by-step
